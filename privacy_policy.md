# Privacy Policy for Velocity Text

**Last Updated:** June 17, 2025

Thank you for using Velocity Text. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information our extension handles and why.

### 1. No Data Collection

Velocity Text is designed to protect your privacy. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or browsing activity.**

All the processing required to modify text on a webpage happens locally within your browser. The extension does not have access to, nor does it send, any information about the pages you visit or the content you read to any external server.

### 2. User Settings

To provide a consistent experience, Velocity Text saves your preferences (the enabled/disabled state and the bolding percentage). This information is stored locally on your computer using the standard `chrome.storage` API.

This data is exclusive to your browser profile and is **never** accessed by us or transmitted anywhere. It is used solely to ensure the extension remembers your settings the next time you use it.

### 3. Permissions

Velocity Text requires the following permissions to function:

* **`activeTab` & `scripting`**: To run the script that bolds text on the page you are currently viewing.
* **`storage`**: To save your settings locally on your device.

These permissions are strictly used to provide the core functionality of the extension and for no other purpose.

### 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected in a new version of the extension. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
